# Encode-and-Decode-of-Messages-using-GUI
Encoding and Decoding of messages done using base64 library in python and GUI tkinter

Message encoding is the process to convert the text into random and meaningless unrecognizable text called ciphertext. 
Decoding is the process to convert that ciphertext to the original text. 
This process is also called the Encryption-Decryption process.


In this project, users have to enter the message to encode or decode.
Input for mode to choose the encoding and decoding process is taken.
The same key must be used to process the encoding and decoding for the same message.
